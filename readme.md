## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

1. **XAMPP** or any other local server with PHP and MySQL support.
2. A web browser to access the application.

---

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   - Clone the repository or download the project files and place them in the `htdocs` folder of your XAMPP installation. For example:
     ```
     c:\xampp\htdocs\bookstore
     ```

2. **Set Up the Database**
   - Open phpMyAdmin (usually accessible at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
   - Create a new database named `bookstore`.
   - Import the SQL file to create the required tables. You can use the following SQL to create the `books` table:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE books (
         id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
         title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         author VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
         isbn VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
         publication_year INT
     );
     ```

3. **Configure Database Connection**
   - Open the file `api/db_config.php` and ensure the database credentials match your local setup:
     ```php
     define('DB_SERVER', 'localhost');
     define('DB_USERNAME', 'root');
     define('DB_PASSWORD', '');
     define('DB_NAME', 'bookstore');
     ```

4. **Start the Server**
   - Start Apache and MySQL from the XAMPP control panel.
   - Access the application in your browser at:
     ```
     http://localhost/bookstore
     ```
